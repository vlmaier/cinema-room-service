<h2>Getting familar with implementing Interfaces</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>We previously used the quite simple <code class="java">Animal</code> interface as an example. Now to get the hang of it, implement the <code class="java">Dog</code> class, which is supposed to implement the <code class="java">Animal</code> interface.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this task, consider the dog being as close to normal as you can imagine. It means that the solutions in which dogs can talk or have a suspiciously large number of limbs will be considered wrong.</p>
<pre><code class="java">fun bark(): String { return barkString }
fun meow(): String { return meowString }
fun speak(): String { return speakString }

fun walk() { /* some code */ }
fun fly() { /* some code */ }
fun swim() { /* some code */ }

interface Animal {
    val numberOfLimbs: Int
    fun move()
    fun communicate(): String
}</code></pre><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
