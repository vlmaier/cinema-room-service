<h2>Getting rid of copy-pasting: constructing an interface</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Suppose you're working with a set of classes as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Triangle {
    val angles: Int = 3
    val scale: Double = 1.0

    fun draw() {
        /* ... */
    }
}

class Rectangle {
    val angles: Int = 4
    val scale: Double  = 1.0

    fun draw() {
        /* ... */
    }
}

class Hexagon {
    val angles: Int = 6
    val scale: Double = 1.0

    fun draw() {
        /* ... */
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, these classes have a few things in common, so it would be convenient in terms of optimizing the code if all of them were implementations of a certain interface.</p>
<p>Introduce an interface so that any of the above classes could be implementations of this interface.   </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>

You may see errors in your code or execution results due to missing context. Donâ€™t worry about it, just write the solution and press Check.
